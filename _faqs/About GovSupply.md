### **What is the difference between SupplyAlly and GovSupply?**
SupplyAlly (SAlly) changed its name to GovSupply from 01 Nov 2023, part of a strategic shift to incorporate all distribution related products into this offering suite called GovDistribute. 



### **Why is GovSupply useful for my distribution?**
GovSupply helps you track whether a person receiving an item has received it before. Before you issue an item to a recipient, use GovSupply to scan the barcode on their valid identification document. GovSupply will tell you if they had collected that item previously.
