### **What is the difference between SupplyAlly and GovSupply?**
SupplyAlly (SAlly) changed its name to GovSupply from 01 Nov 2023, part of a strategic shift to incorporate all distribution related products into this offering suite called GovDistribute. 



### **Why is GovSupply useful for my distribution?**
GovSupply helps you track whether a person receiving an item has received it before. Before you issue an item to a recipient, use GovSupply to scan the barcode on their valid identification document. GovSupply will tell you if they had collected that item previously. 


### **Where to download GovSupply App?**
You can download the app from the [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.musket&hl=en) or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/supplyally/id1497126533). 

### **How do I start using GovSupply App?**
You should have a unique login QR code issued to you by your appointed organisation. 

Ensure that your device has a back-facing camera and a valid mobile number that is connected to the internet. 

Scan the login QR code and input your phone number. You will receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS. Enter the OTP to proceed. Once you have successfully logged in, you may start using the app by scanning identification cards' barcode or manually inputting them.

### **Do I need to scan the login QR code each time I use GovSupply?**
No, you will be automatically logged in each time you launch GovSupply as long as you have not logged out previously. If your login QR code has expired, you will need to obtain a new login QR code from your organisation.

### **Do I need to log out of GovSupply App?**
If you are using GovSupply on a shared device, we recommend logging out of GovSupply to prevent misuse. You will be able to re-login to GovSupply with your login QR code and same mobile number.

### **The login QR code does not seem to work. What do I do?**
Your login QR code might have already been tied to another phone number, or the login QR code you are using has expired. 

If you are unable to login with your QR Code, check with your organisation to get a replacement login QR code. 


### **What are considered valid forms of identification?**
Physical NRIC/FIN cards, birth certificates, PG/MG card,  driving licence, and SingPass Mobile’s Profile page (barcode feature) are valid forms of identification. 

### **What do I do if GovSupply hangs or does not work?**
If you encounter an issue, try closing the app and opening it again. If it still does not work, please start recording the following details on paper:
* Date/Time of transaction
* Number of users affected
* Your organisation
* Location where scanning of identification took place
* First 13 characters of your login QR codes that do not work. This can be found at the left of the QR code (abcdef12-3456…)

You will be able to enter the recorded details into GovSupply manually later on. If the problem persists, please email to [govsupply_support@tech.gov.sg](mailto:govsupply_support@tech.gov.sg)



### **My screen looks different from my colleagues. What should I do?**
Do not checkout for that transaction. 
Your app might not be updated. 
1. Please close the app and remove it from background. 
2. Restart app and press on "update" on the yellow banner.
3. Once your app is updated, perform that transaction again. 
4. If you still noticed the difference, please logout and rescan your QR code to login again.
