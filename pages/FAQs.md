### **Where to download SupplyAlly App?**
You can download the app from the [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.musket&hl=en) or [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/supplyally/id1497126533). 

### **How do I start using SupplyAlly App?**
You should have a unique login QR code issued to you by your appointed organisation. 

Ensure that your device has a back-facing camera and a valid mobile number that is connected to the internet. 

Scan the QR code and input your phone number. You will receive a One-Time Password (OTP) via SMS. Enter the OTP to proceed. Once you have successfully logged in, you may start using the app by scanning identification cards' barcode or manually inputting them.

### **Do I need to scan the QR code each time I use SupplyAlly?**
No, you will be automatically logged in each time you launch SupplyAlly as long as you have not logged out previously. If your login QR code has expired, you will need to obtain a new login QR code from your organisation.

### **Do I need to log out of SupplyAlly App?**
If you are using SupplyAlly on a shared device, we recommend logging out of SupplyAlly to prevent misuse. You will be able to re-login to SupplyAlly with your login QR code and same mobile number.

### **The QR code does not seem to work. What do I do?**
Your login QR code might have already been tied to another phone number, or the login QR code you are using has expired. 

If you are unable to login with your QR Code, check with your organisation to get a replacement QR code. 


### **What are considered valid forms of identification?**
Physical NRIC/FIN cards, birth certificates, PG/MG card,  driving licence, and SingPass Mobile’s Profile page (barcode feature) are valid forms of identification. 

### **What do I do if SupplyAlly hangs or does not work?**
If you encounter an issue, try closing the app and opening it again. If it still does not work, please start recording the following details on paper:
* Date/Time of transaction
* Number of users affected
* Your organisation
* Location where scanning of identification took place
* First 13 characters of your QR codes that do not work. This can be found at the left of the QR code (abcdef12-3456…)

You will be able to enter the recorded details into SupplyAlly manually later on. If the problem persists, please submit a request on Zendesk or email to [supplyallyhelp@hive.gov.sg](mailto:supplyallyhelp@hive.gov.sg)
